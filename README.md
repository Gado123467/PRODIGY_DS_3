# PRODIGY_DS_3



# Bank Dataset Visualization

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create **bar charts** and **histograms** to visualize the distribution of variables in a Bank dataset. The dataset typically contains information about clients, their demographics, and banking behaviors.

## Objectives

* Explore the bank dataset to understand customer demographics and behaviors
* Visualize categorical variables (e.g., job, marital status, housing loan) using bar charts
* Visualize continuous variables (e.g., age, account balance) using histograms
* Gain insights into patterns that may influence banking decisions

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following key columns:

* `age`: Age of the client
* `job`: Job type (admin, technician, etc.)
* `marital`: Marital status (single, married, divorced)
* `education`: Education level
* `default`: Has credit in default (yes/no)
* `balance`: Average yearly balance in euros
* `housing`: Has housing loan (yes/no)
* `loan`: Has personal loan (yes/no)
* `contact`: Contact communication type (cellular, telephone)
* `day`, `month`, `duration`: Last contact date and duration
* `campaign`, `pdays`, `previous`, `poutcome`: Marketing campaign data
* `y`: Outcome of the marketing campaign (yes/no)

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas (data handling)
* Matplotlib or Seaborn (visualization)

## Steps

1. Load the bank dataset
2. Select variables to analyze (categorical or continuous)
3. Choose the appropriate chart type:

   * Bar chart for categorical variables (e.g., `job`, `marital`, `housing`)
   * Histogram for continuous variables (e.g., `age`, `balance`)
4. Plot the chart
5. Interpret the distribution and patterns



## Use Cases

* Understanding customer demographics
* Identifying patterns in banking behavior
* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) for marketing campaigns or financial studies
